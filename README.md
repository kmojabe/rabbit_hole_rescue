# Rabbit Hole

### Rabbit Hole 

Rabbithole is a Chrome Extension that lets you analyze your browsing habits. Sometimes, when you’re doing research, you don’t just want to save a page; you want to save a whole group of tabs. If you get somewhere interesting, you may ask yourself, “How did I get here?” Rabbithole will tell you how, and let you save those paths.

Rabbithole will be accompanied by a Web application which lets a user visualize and interact with these saved paths. Potentially add a favorites feature -- favorite an entire tree/subtree: a RABBITHOLE!
